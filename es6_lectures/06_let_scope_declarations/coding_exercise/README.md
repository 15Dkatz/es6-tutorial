##Coding Exercise: Let's Scope 'lets'

###Problem Statement:
Let's reinforce the idea of variables scoping with 'let' with a short coding exercise!

Remember that with scoping we can re-use the same variable name.

**Directions:**

Consider this run function. In its scope, on line 3, the variable 'b' = 2.â€‹ However, on line 6, a new block scope, { .. } is declared.

On line 7, use the 'let' keyword to change 'b' to 3 in the new scope. The console.logs should output '2, 3'.
