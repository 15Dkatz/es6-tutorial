##Coding Exercise: Scaling Maps (Map Helper Method)

Time to practice the map helper method.

**Directions:**
Lewis has a list of path lengths in inches on his map, represented by this array.
```javascript
let lengths = [3, 7, 5];
```
Now, Lewis and his best friend, Clark, want to know how long these paths are in real life. Luckily, they know that an inch on the map equals 8 miles in real life.

Fix the scale function to return a new array with the values that Lewis and Clark want. Use a map helper method, and the 'multiple' parameter to do so.
