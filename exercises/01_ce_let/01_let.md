##Coding Exercise: Let's scope lets

###Description:
Let's reinforce the idea of variables scoping with 'let'!

Remember that with scoping we can re-use the same variable name.

So, let a variable, b, equal 2.

Console.log that variable, b.

Then, in a new scope block, { .. }, let a variable, b, equal 3.

Console.log that variable, b, within the scope block.
