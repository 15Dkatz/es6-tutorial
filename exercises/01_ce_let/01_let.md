##Coding Exercise: Let's Scope 'lets'

###Description:
Let's reinforce the idea of variables scoping with 'let' with a short coding exercise! Remember that with scoping we can re-use the same variable name.

Directions:
Consider this run function. It has a block scope, { .. }. Also, on line 3, the variable 'b' = 2.â€‹

On line 7, use the 'let' keyword to change 'b' to 3. The console.logs should output '2, 3'.
