##Coding Exercise: Butter Spread

###Problem Statement:
Let's practice using the spread/rest operator!

**Directions:**
We have a function 'butter'. Right now it only returns the array 'a', [1, 2, 3];

Later on, we call, butter(4, 5, 6). But instead of [1, 2, 3], we want butter to return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

How can we take advantage of the spread operator to make butter simply return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]?

Hint: we have to use the spread syntax ( ... ) twice.
