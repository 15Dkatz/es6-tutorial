<!-- ##Coding Exercise: Filtering For Stars (Filter Helper Method)

Let's get some practice with the filter method!

**Directions:**
Jeremy coaches a basketball team, and he has a list of all the players' average points per game. Now, according to Jeremy, any player averaging over 15 points deserves celebration. His list:

```javascript
const averages = [6, 15.7, 9, 18, 22.1, 9.2, 4];
```

Help Jeremy finish his highlight method so that it returns a new array of players averaging over 15 points. Use the filter method.
