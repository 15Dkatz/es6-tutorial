##Coding Exercise: Inheriting Powers (Class Inheritance)

Let's practice some ES6 inheritance!

**Directions:**
Here we have a Wizard class. We even have an instance of Wizard called Gandalf with a power of 100. However, Gandalf's power() method doesn't seem to work at the moment. Make two fixes to the Wizard class:

1) Use the constructor's power_level parameter to set the Wizard's power_level to that power_level (Hint: think about 'this').

2) Give the Wizard class a power() method that simply returns its own power_level.
