##Coding Exercise: Mastering Template Literals & ES6 Strings

###Problem Statement:
Template literals and ES6 Strings become really powerful to use once you get used to seeing the funny looking syntax.

So let's become ES6 jedi-masters and hone our template skills.

**Directions:**
Change the message in the print function to log this:

'Luke first uses a blue-colored lightsaber. But his father, Vader, wields a red-colored lightsaber.'

Although pre-es6 code will work, try using the variables, and template literal syntax, `${...}` to do so.
